## README

Material for the BCI Workshop held at District 3 in May 2015 by BCI Montr√©al.

See the document ```INSTRUCTIONS.md``` for instructions to follow for the workshop.

## Prior to the workshop

Before coming to the workshop, please **download and install all the required dependencies** (see ```INSTRUCTIONS.md```). Since the whole download/installation process takes **around 30 minutes**, you will most likely miss the first part of the workshop if you haven't done it before coming.

If for some reason you can't download/install the dependencies, please bring a USB stick to the workshop so you can make a copy of somebody else's installation files.
